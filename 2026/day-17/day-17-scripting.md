### Task 3: Command-Line Arguments
1. Create `greet.sh` that:

   - If no argument is passed, prints "Usage: ./greet.sh <name>"


[Script](Scripts/greet1.sh)

2. Create `args_demo.sh` that:

   - Prints all arguments (`$@`)
   - Prints the script name (`$0`)

### Task 4: Install Packages via Script
1. Create `install_packages.sh` that:
   - Defines a list of packages: `nginx`, `curl`, `wget`
   - Loops through the list
   - Checks if each package is installed (use `dpkg -s` or `rpm -q`)
   - Installs it if missing, skips if already present
   - Prints status for each package

> Run as root: `sudo -i` or `sudo su`

[Script](Scripts/install_packages.sh)

### Task 5: Error Handling
1. Create `safe_script.sh` that:
   - Uses `set -e` at the top (exit on error)
   - Tries to create a directory `/tmp/devops-test`
   - Tries to navigate into it
   - Creates a file inside
   - Uses `||` operator to print an error if any step fails

Example:
```bash
mkdir /tmp/devops-test || echo "Directory already exists"
```

2. Modify your `install_packages.sh` to check if the script is being run as root — exit with a message if not.
